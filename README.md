## Feature Introduction

The base version of Covey.Town lacks an invitation system that allows users to both invite and accept invitations from their friends. To increase the interactivity between users, we added such a system. To invite a user, a user can direct the invite tab at the bottom of the app. Under this tab, he/she can either click the invite button next to his/her friend or copy the invitation link and send it to the friend via social media. On the one hand, to accept invitations for a user currently on the town list page (the user has already created a username), he/she can view all invitations sent by others from the town invitation box and choose to accept or deny any invitation. On the other hand, for a user who hasn't created a username, he/she can use an invitation link to join the Covey.Town: the link will direct him/her to a page asking for a username and display the town name that he/she is entering.

## Identifier of a user: username

Since the invitation system needs something to keep track of user identification, we will always ask for a username before a user enters a town.
